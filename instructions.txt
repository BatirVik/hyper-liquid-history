Technical Test â€“ Extraction of Completed Perpetual Trades on HyperLiquid

Objective
Reconstruct the history of completed perpetual trades (positions opened and then closed) for a HyperLiquid user, based on the data available via the public API.

Instructions
Develop a Python script executable from the command line that:
- Asks the user to enter a wallet address
- Retrieves and rebuilds the list of their completed perpetual trades
- Displays for each trade:
  - The coin (e.g., ETH, BTC)
  - The direction (long / short)
  - The opening time of the position
  - The duration the position remained open
  - The realized PnL (in USD)

The script must be:
- Easy to run (python script.py)
- Robust (handle empty cases, request errors, etc.)
- Documented

Files to submit
- script.py: main script
- requirements.txt: required libraries
